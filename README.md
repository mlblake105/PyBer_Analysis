# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
A ride-sharing app company would like to analyze rideshare data by city type to show the total weekly fares for each city type.  This information will be used to determine how the data differs by city type which will impact future decisions by the company.

## Analysis Results
  - Deliverable 1- A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type

## Summary

- In rural markets I would recommend adding additional drivers.  The number of rides exceeds drivers, and the average fare per driver is much higher than average fare per ride for suburban and urban areas.
- In urban markets I would recommend decreasing the amount of drivers.  Driver fare compared to average fare per ride suggests the amount of drivers could be decreased to balance drivers vs rides requested.
- Most of the companies revenue is made through urban markets.  If the company is looking to make any investments they should be towards this segment.
